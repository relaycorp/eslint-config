# `@relaycorp/eslint-config`

ESLint configuration for all Relaycorp JS projects.

It's insane we have to create a repo and NPM package just for this, but TSLint requires a dedicated NPM module, so we couldn't just add the configuration to [`shared-config`](https://github.com/relaycorp/shared-config).
